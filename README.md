# Rapture State Toolkit
Rapture State Toolkit is the multi-functional modular set of static C++ libraries.
The main purpose of this project is to make development more effective and clear.

RS-Toolkit does not only extensively use almost every feature of C++ 11 and 14 standards,
it also embodies some useful concepts, such as SFINAE, reference-based memory management,
RTTI, static-function-based singletons, etc.
The main focus is made on compile-time programming.

Each library has its own power. There is no need to use all the libraries.
Feel free to take only libraries which you need!

RS-Toolkit uses CMake to build libraries. There is some additional cmake tools that help
to create new libraries, add sources and manage dependencies in very simple way.
