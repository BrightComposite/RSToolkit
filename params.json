{"name":"Rapturestatetoolkit","tagline":"The flexible and extensible set of static libraries for productive and enjoyable development","body":"## Rapture State Toolkit\r\nRapture State Toolkit is the multi-functional modular set of static C++ libraries.\r\nThe main purpose of this project is to make development more effective and clear.\r\n\r\nRS-Toolkit does not only extensively use almost every feature of C++ 11 and 14 standards,\r\nit also embodies some useful concepts, such as SFINAE, reference-based memory management,\r\nRTTI, static-function-based singletons, etc.\r\nThe main focus is made on compile-time programming.\r\n\r\nEach library has its own power. There is no need to use all the libraries.\r\nFeel free to take only libraries which you need!\r\n\r\nRS-Toolkit uses CMake to build libraries. There is some additional cmake tools that help\r\nto create new libraries, add sources and manage dependencies in very simple way.\r\n\r\n### Rapture Core\r\nWill be added soon.\r\n\r\n### Rapture Messages\r\nWill be added soon.\r\n\r\n### Rapture Application\r\nWill be added soon.\r\n\r\n### Rapture Math\r\nWill be added soon.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
